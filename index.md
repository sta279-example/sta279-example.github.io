# Teaching Demonstration: STA 279 Statistical Computing

## Context and background

I have created this course website for a teaching demonstration at Wake Forest University, in which I will be presenting a lecture from my course STA 279 Statistical Computing. This example lecture -- which can be found on the [Course Calendar](https://sta279-example.github.io/calendar/) page, along with the associated class activity and a sample homework assignment -- has been used for the first class of the semester in STA 279. This first lesson covers some R basics in the context of a probability simulation. Simulation studies comprise the first unit of STA 279, providing context and motivation for basic data types, iteration, and general coding practices.

## What this website contains

I use websites like this one for all my courses, with basically the same overall structure. To give a better sense of what my courses are like, I have created this example website which includes the teaching demonstration, plus additional information and context about STA 279. Full course websites from previous iterations of STA 279 (or other courses) can be provided on request.

* Lecture notes, class activities, and assignments can be found in the [Course Calendar](https://sta279-example.github.io/calendar/)

* The [Syllabus](https://sta279-example.github.io/about/) contains information about course topics, policies, and grading
